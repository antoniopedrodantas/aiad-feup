# Second Assignment

# Lift Management System
In this second assignment, a simulation environment was developed for the MAS created in the first work. For this purpose, two tools were used, Repast and SAJaS. 

When executing the Multi-Agent System, data will be collected regarding the interactions between elevators and orders. This information is observable in real time, using various types of tools provided by Repast (Network graph, Histograms, Grids and Line graph).

If the objective is only to collect data for further analysis, it is possible to run the simulation in BATCH mode, where there will be no graphical interface.
