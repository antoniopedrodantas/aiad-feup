# First Assignment

# Lift Management System

Managing the **Lift System** in a big skyscraper is a fairly complex task.

With many requests being made in a relatively short amount of time, **optimizing elevator allocation** for each call is essential to ensure everyone gets to their destination in a reasonable amount of time.

The objective of this project is to develop a **Multi-Agent System** for the management of a set of elevators in a building.
